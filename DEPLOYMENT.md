**ðŸš€ Quick Terminal Commands:** See [DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md](DEPLOYMENT_COMMANDS.md) for copy-paste ready commands!

This guide explains how to deploy the Happy Birthday animation to GitHub Pages and how your code changes will reflect on the live site.

## How Your Code Changes Reflect on the Site

**Important:** Only changes pushed to the `main` branch will appear on the live site!

### Quick Steps to Deploy Your Changes:

1. **Make your code changes** in any branch
2. **Test your changes locally** by opening `happy-birthday-animation/index.html` in a browser
3. **Commit your changes**: `git add .` then `git commit -m "Your message"`
4. **Push to your branch**: `git push origin your-branch-name`
5. **Create a Pull Request** (PR) to merge your branch into `main`
6. **Merge the PR** into `main` (or push directly to `main` if you have permissions)
7. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for GitHub Actions to deploy automatically
8. **Visit** `https://laxminarayan24.github.io/Happy-Birthday/` to see your changes live!

### Why Changes Don't Appear Immediately

- Changes must be on the `main` branch to trigger deployment
- If you're working on a feature branch (like `copilot/update-code-changes`), your changes won't appear until merged to `main`
- After merging to `main`, GitHub Actions takes 1-2 minutes to build and deploy

## Automatic Deployment

The repository is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages. Here's what happens:

1. When code is pushed to the `main` branch, the GitHub Actions workflow triggers
2. The workflow builds and deploys the `happy-birthday-animation` directory to GitHub Pages
3. The site becomes available at: `https://laxminarayan24.github.io/Happy-Birthday/`
4. The entire process takes 1-2 minutes from push to live deployment

## Setting Up GitHub Pages (One-Time Setup)

**Important:** The repository owner needs to enable GitHub Pages for the first deployment to work.

### Steps:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/LAXMINARAYAN24/Happy-Birthday`
2. Click on **Settings** (in the repository menu)
3. In the left sidebar, click on **Pages** (under "Code and automation")
4. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions"
5. Save the settings

That's it! The workflow will automatically deploy the site when you merge this PR to the `main` branch.

## After Setup

Once GitHub Pages is enabled:
- The site will be available at: **https://laxminarayan24.github.io/Happy-Birthday/**
- Any push to the `main` branch will trigger an automatic redeployment
- You can manually trigger a deployment by going to Actions tab â†’ "Deploy to GitHub Pages" â†’ "Run workflow"

## Sharing the Link

Simply share this URL with your friends:
```
https://laxminarayan24.github.io/Happy-Birthday/
```

## Customization

To personalize the greeting card:
1. Edit `happy-birthday-animation/index.html`
2. Find the line with `<greeting-card name="Geetu" message="HAPPY BIRTHDAY"></greeting-card>`
3. Change the `name` attribute to your friend's name
4. Commit and push to `main` branch
5. The site will automatically redeploy with your changes!

## Troubleshooting

### My changes aren't showing on the live site!
1. **Check your branch**: Run `git branch` - are you on the `main` branch?
   - If not, you need to merge your changes to `main`
   - Create a PR or merge directly: `git checkout main && git merge your-branch`
2. **Check the workflow**: Go to the Actions tab on GitHub to see if deployment succeeded
3. **Clear your cache**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. **Wait**: Give it 2-3 minutes after pushing to `main` for changes to appear

### Site not loading after deployment
- Wait a few minutes after the first deployment
- Check the Actions tab to see if the workflow completed successfully
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

### 404 Error
- Make sure the workflow has completed successfully
- Verify the `main` branch has the latest changes
- Check that GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions"

### Changes not appearing
- Check the Actions tab to see if deployment completed
- Clear your browser cache and refresh
- Wait 1-2 minutes for GitHub's CDN to update
