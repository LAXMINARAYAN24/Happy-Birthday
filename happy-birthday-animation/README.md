# Happy Birthday Animation

This project is a simple web-based animation that celebrates a birthday with a colorful display of letters and fireworks on a canvas. 

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the webpage. It includes a canvas element for the animation, links to the CSS for styling, and the JavaScript file for functionality.
  
- `css/style.css`: Contains the styles for the webpage, defining the layout, background gradient, and styles for the canvas and footer text.

- `js/script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that handles the animation logic, creating a birthday animation using a canvas, defining properties for the letters and fireworks, and managing the animation loop.

- `README.md`: This documentation file provides instructions on how to run the animation and any other relevant information.

- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git, such as node_modules or any build artifacts.

## How to Run the Animation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
